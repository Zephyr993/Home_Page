## Project Description

AnxietyGo is a social anxiety app designed to help individuals who struggle with social anxiety or related disorders. The app provides a supportive and safe environment for users to connect with others who share similar experiences, and to access a range of resources and tools to manage their anxiety and improve their mental health.

The app features a clean and intuitive user interface, with a range of features designed to help users manage their anxiety and improve their social skills. These features include a social networking platform, guided meditations, cognitive-behavioral therapy exercises, and more.

The project has a strong focus on open-source development and community collaboration. We welcome flutter developers, designers, and marketers who are passionate about mental health and social impact to join our team and help us make a positive difference in the lives of individuals struggling with social anxiety.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Download and install any IDE that supports Flutter or the Dart Language
- Download and install the latest version of the Flutter Framework. See https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install
- Download and install the latest version of Git on your system. See https://git-scm.com/downloads.
    - To make sure if your Git is on the latest version, run this command on the command line: `git -v`.
- Download and install the latest version of NodeJS and npm on your system. See https://nodejs.org/en/.
    - npm is included with the NodeJS installation. This means that you only have to download and run the NodeJS installer.

    - To make sure if your npm is on the latest version, run this command on the command line: `npm -v`.

If you prefer the command line way of downloading and installing things, then feel free to do so. Otherwise, the instructions above should get you up and running.

### How to run
